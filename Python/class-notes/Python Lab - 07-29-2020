Problem: Write a short Python program that asks the user to enter Celsius temperature (it can be a decimal number), converts the entered temperature into Fahrenheit degree and prints the result.

Solution:
print("Enter celcius value: ", end="")
celcius = input()
fahrenheit = float(celcius) * 1.8 + 32
print("Fahrenait values is", fahrenheit)



Problem: Write a short Python program that asks the user to enter a distance (it can be a decimal number) in kilometers, converts the entered distance into miles and prints the result.

Solution:

km = float(input("Enter a kilometer value :"))
miles = km / 1.6
print("Conversion is ", miles)


print("Enter the distance in km:", end ="")
distance_in_km = float(input())
distance_in_miles = float(distance_in_km * 0.621371)
print(distance_in_miles)



Problem: Estimating the risk of death from coronavirus.
Consider the following questions in terms of True/False regarding someone else.
 -Are you a cigarette addict older than 75 years old? Variable → age
 -Do you have a severe chronic disease? Variable → chronic
 -Is your immune system too weak? Variable → immune

Set a logical algorithm using boolean logic operators (and/or) and the given variables in order to give us True (there is a risk of death) or False (there is not a risk of death) as a result.

Solution:

age = False
chronic = False
immune = False
total = bool(age) or bool(chronic) or bool(immune)
print(total)



Problem: Using the all following items once each, set a correct boolean expression that returns write me. Use the print() function to display the result. 

0
and
not
"write me"

Solution:

print(not 0 and "write me")



Problem: Using the all following items, set a correct boolean expression that returns []. Use the print() function to display the result. 

{0}
or
and
[]
False

Solution:

print({0} and False or [])



Problem: Remove a specific char at a specific/given index from a string.
Given a string (clarusway) and an index number int n (n=3), return a new string where the character at index n has been removed.

Solution:

x = "clarusway"
ind = 3
first_part = x[:ind]
second_part = x[ind+1:]
print(first_part + second_part)



Problem: In order to print the following text using .format() method, arrange the variable text.

Hello! I am a new programmer and I love Clarusway.
Note : Use only given three words ("Hello", "new", "love") in the .format parentheses.

Solution:

print("{0}! I am a {1} programmer and I {2} Clarusway".format("Hello","new","love"))

print("{h} I am a {n} programer and I {l} Clarusway".format(n = "new", l = "love", h = "Hello"))



Problem: Type a Python code to get the output of “Susan is a young lady and she is a student at the CLRWY IT university.”, using f-string with the variables below. (Use multiline f-string)

name = "Susan"
age = "young"
gender = "lady"
school = "CLRWY IT university"

Solution:

first = 'Susan'
second = 'young'
third = 'lady'
fourth = 'CLRWY IT university'
output = (f"{first} is a {second} {third}"
         f"and she is a student at the {fourth}."
         f"And she loves her school a lot")
print(output)


first = 'Susan'
second = 'young'
third = 'lady'
fourth = 'CLRWY IT university'
output = f"{first} is a {second} {third}" \
         f"and she is a student at the {fourth}." \
         f"And she loves her school a lot"
print(output)
