## Part 1 - Getting to know REST API

[REST (REpresentational State Transfer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services.

Features of a REST architecture can be defined as followings:

- **Client-Server:** The server offers a service, and the client consumes it.

- **Stateless:** The server does not have to remember previous requests from the client, in other words the server does not keep the session information of the client.

- **Cacheable:** The server must indicate to the clients and intermediaries if requests can be cached or not.

- **Uniform Interface:** The uniform interface is the fundamental of RESTful Services and simplifies the communication between the Server and Client.

- **Layered System:** A client does not know whether it communicates with the end server, or with an intermediary along the way. Besides, a server can send requests to the multiple other servers/microservices to generate a response.

- **Code on demand (optional):** Servers can optionally provide executable code or scripts to clients in their context.

![REST API Methods](./rest-api-methods.png)

Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called **RESTful Web service** or **Web API (Application Programming Interface)** and designed to fit the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

Within the Web APIs, resources are represented by [URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier). The clients send requests to the server using URIs with the HTTP methods `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` and the Server send response with data in any media type but JSON format is the most commonly used one in the market.

Within this hands-on, we will create a `Bookstore` Application as Web Service.  Below table shows the standard implementation of REST API for the `Bookstore` app and how the HTTP methods are designed to affect the given resources identified by URIs.

| HTTP Method  | Action | Example|
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET`     |   Obtain information about a resource | http://api.example.com/books (retrieves list of all books) |
| `GET`     |   Obtain information about a resource | http://api.example.com/books/123 (retrieves book with id=123) |
| `POST`    |   Create a new resource               | http://api.example.com/books (creates a new book, from data provided with the request) |
| `PUT`     |   Update a resource                   | http://api.example.com/books/123 (updates the book with id=123, from data provided with the request) |
| `DELETE`  |   Delete a resource                   | http://api.example.com/books/123 (delete the book with id=123) |

## Part 2 - Creating REST API Implementation with Flask framework using `sqlite` database on GitHub Repo

- Create a `Bookstore` application as web service with base URL of `http://[public-dns-name-of-ec2]/` and expose the resources listed above within.

- Define a book with following fields:

  - book_id: unique identifier for books, type is numeric.

  - title: title of the book, type is string.

  - author: author of the book. type is string.

  - is_sold: book availability status, type is boolean.

- Create folder named `flask-04-creating-rest-api-on-ec2-linux2` within `clarusway-python-workshop` repo

- Write an REST API application using `sqlite` database and save the complete code as `book-api.py` under `hands-on/flask-04-creating-rest-api-on-ec2-linux2` folder.

```

- Add and commit all changes on local repo

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'added book-api.py'
```

- Push all the files to remote repo `clarusway-python-workshop` on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin master
```

## Part 3 - Deploying the REST API Implementation with Flask Server on Amazon Linux 2 EC2 Instance

- Launch an Amazon EC2 instance using the Amazon Linux 2 AMI with security group allowing SSH (Port 22) and HTTP (Port 80) connections.

- Connect to your instance with SSH.

```bash
ssh -i .ssh/call-training.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-15-183-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

- Update the installed packages and package cache on your instance.

```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

- Install `Python 3` packages.

```bash
sudo yum install python3 -y
```

- Check the python3 version

```bash
python3 --version
```

- Install `Python 3 Flask` framework.

```bash
sudo pip3 install flask
```

- Install `flask_sqlalchemy`.

```bash
sudo pip3 install flask_sqlalchemy
```

## Part 4 - Testing the API Implementation on EC2 Instance

- Download the web application file from GitHub repo.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/callahan-cw/clarusway-python-workshop/master/hands-on/flask-04-creating-rest-api-on-ec2-linux2/app-form-handling.py/book-api.py 
```

- Run the `Bookstore` API.

```bash
sudo python3 book-api.py
```

- Open the `Bookstore` API from the web browser.

```bash
localhost:5000
```

- Open the `Bookstore` API default `/` page from the terminal with `curl` command.

```bash
curl localhost:5000/books
```

- List all book in  the `Bookstore` API using `/books` path and HTTP `GET` method with `curl` command.

```bash
curl -X GET localhost:5000/books
```

- Retrieve book with `id=3` using `/books/3` path and HTTP `GET` method with `curl` command.

```bash
curl -X GET localhost:5000/books/3
```

- Try to retrieve non-existing book using `/books/10` path and HTTP `GET` method with `curl` command to see 404 response.

```bash
curl -X GET localhost:5000/books/10
```

- Create new book the `Bookstore` using `/books` path and HTTP `POST` method with `curl` command.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"Hands-on  with Call"}'  localhost:5000/books
```

- Add author to the book with `id=4` using `/books/4` path and HTTP `PUT` method with `curl` command.

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"author":"Callahan"}'  localhost:5000/books/4
```

- Delete book with `id=1` using `/books/1` path and HTTP `DELETE` method with `curl` command.

```bash
curl -X DELETE  localhost:5000/books/1
```

- List all books with latest states from the web browser.

```bash
curl -X GET localhost:5000/books
```
